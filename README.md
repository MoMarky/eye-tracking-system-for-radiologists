# eye-tracking-system-for-radiologists
We introduce an eye-tracking system for radiologists based on ClearCanvas project.

**First, you should download the ClearCanvas source code and compile it.**
ClearCanvas source code can be found at [ClearCanvas Project](https://clearcanvas.github.io/).
ClearCanvas is an open source code (C#) base for enabling software innovation in medical imaging. It contains a DICOM Viewer and a DICOM Server. In this project, we only use DICOM Viewer for image viewing. You hace to open "ImageViewer.sln" with VisualStudio software and compile the project.

**Second, copy the code from the "Modified Code" folder to the appropriate location to overwrite the original code.**
